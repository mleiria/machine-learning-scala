## Machine Learning for Scala 

### Algorithms:

Linear Regression is implemented using Gradient Descent

- Linear Regression with one variable (using Array[Double] as xTrain)
- Linear Regression with multiple variables (using DenseMatrix[Double, Double] and DenseVector[Double] as xTrain and yTrain)



#### Note: 
- There's a folder named *Documentation* with some notes, handwritten by me, on the math behind this algorithms
